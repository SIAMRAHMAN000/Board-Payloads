**rr.ino:** Once plugged in, it hits win+r which opens the run menu. Then it waits 0.6 seconds and then types out the [rickroll link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), and then it hits enter and voila, the victim would be rickrolled

**rr_mac.ino:** Once plugged in, it hits cmd+space which opens spotlight. Then it waits 0.6 seconds and then types out the [rickroll link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), and then it hits enter after 3 seconds and voila, the victim would be rickrolled. There are more delays in this compared to the windows version cause mac does not like such high speed inputs
